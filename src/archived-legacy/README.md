# Archived Legacy SCSS Files

## Purpose
This directory contains SCSS files that were archived during the **Phase 10 Week 4 SCSS Legacy System Modernization** process. These files contained significant legacy metaphorical terminology but were not actively imported in the main SCSS architecture.

## What Was Archived
These files were **orphaned** (not imported in `src/core/_main.scss`) and contained heavy legacy terminology:

### Audio Files (176 total legacy occurrences)
- `_music-reactive-effects.scss` (74 occurrences)
- `_visual-effects-variables.scss` (102 occurrences)

### Color Files (93 total legacy occurrences)  
- `_emotional-temperature-colors.scss` (15 occurrences)
- `_genre-specific-presets.scss` (14 occurrences)
- `_oklab-animations.scss` (59 occurrences)
- `_perceptual-blending.scss` (5 occurrences)

### Visual Files (54 total legacy occurrences)
- `_ambient-background-effects.scss` (18 occurrences)
- `_dramatic_visual_theme.scss` (31 occurrences)
- `_neon-glow-theme.scss` (5 occurrences)

**Total**: 323 legacy occurrences removed from active codebase

## Impact
- ✅ **Zero Breaking Changes** - These files were not imported in the main SCSS architecture
- ✅ **24% Legacy Reduction** - Removed 323/1336 total legacy occurrences
- ✅ **Code Preservation** - All legacy code maintained for reference
- ✅ **Easy Restoration** - Files can be restored from archive if needed

## Architecture Decision
These files represented earlier development phases with heavy metaphorical terminology that conflicted with our modern technical naming standards. Rather than modernize unused code, we archived them to focus modernization efforts on active systems.

## Restoration Process
If any archived file needs to be restored:
1. Copy file back to its original location in `src/features/music-sync/`
2. Add import statement to `src/core/_main.scss` if needed
3. Update any legacy terminology to match current standards
