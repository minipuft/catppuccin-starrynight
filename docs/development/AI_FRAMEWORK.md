## 6. **R**eflect & Refine

### Clarification Protocols

Proactively ask when:

- Multiple Year 3000 System integration approaches exist
- Performance vs. functionality trade-offs need user input
- Accessibility requirements impact design decisions
- Breaking changes to existing IManagedSystem interfaces

### Standard Clarification Questions

```markdown
Architecture:

- "Should I extend BaseVisualSystem or create a new manager pattern?"
- "Do you prefer WebGL acceleration or Canvas 2D for broader compatibility?"

Performance:

- "Should I optimize for 60fps on high-end hardware or 30fps compatibility?"
- "Would you like automatic quality scaling or manual performance controls?"

Accessibility:

- "Should reduced motion disable effects entirely or use subtle alternatives?"
- "Do you need keyboard navigation for all visual effect controls?"

Integration:

- "Should this system register with MasterAnimationCoordinator or run independently?"
- "Would you like this to integrate with the existing ColorHarmonyEngine?"
```

### Alternative Solutions Framework
