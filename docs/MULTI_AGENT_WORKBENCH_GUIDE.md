## 🎯 Best Practices

### Agent Coordination
1. **Always check project status first** - Review current phase and build health before starting work
2. **Verify phase dependencies** - Ensure prerequisite phases are complete
3. **Update status at milestones** - Update agent-coordination.md at significant progress points
4. **Use task workspaces** - Maintain detailed progress in plans/tasks/[task-name]/ folders
5. **Validate builds frequently** - Run npm run build to ensure changes don't break compilation
6. **Document completion clearly** - Mark phases complete with clear success criteria

### Dependency Management
1. **Follow phase gates** - Respect sequential phase dependencies (Alpha → Beta → Gamma/Delta)
2. **Check technical dependencies** - Review plans/dependencies.md for cross-system requirements
3. **Validate integration points** - Test system integration after significant changes
4. **Maintain performance budgets** - Monitor bundle size and compilation time targets
5. **Document architectural changes** - Update documentation when system architecture changes

### Development Efficiency
1. **Focus on bundle optimization** - Target specific bundle size reductions for each phase
2. **Maintain test coverage** - Ensure 90%+ test coverage throughout development
3. **Follow established patterns** - Use existing architectural patterns for consistency
4. **Monitor performance impact** - Track compilation time and runtime performance
5. **Archive completed work** - Move completed phases to archive to reduce planning overhead
