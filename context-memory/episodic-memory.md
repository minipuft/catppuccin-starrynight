## Summarized History (Pre-2025-05)

### Project Genesis
- **Period**: 2024-12 to 2025-04
- **Summary**: Conceived as consciousness-aware Spicetify theme inspired by Year 3000 design philosophy. Initial prototypes explored organic animations and musical consciousness synchronization.
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Proof of concept for music visualization
  - Basic consciousness patterns established
  - Performance baseline defined

### Early Experiments
- **Failed Attempts**:
  - Canvas-only rendering (too CPU intensive)
  - Pure CSS animations (lacked dynamism)
  - External animation libraries (bundle size explosion)
- **Successful Discoveries**:
  - Hybrid WebGL/CSS approach
  - CSS variable batching concept
  - Modular system architecture
