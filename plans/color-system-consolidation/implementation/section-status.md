# Implementation Section Status

**Section**: Implementation | **Phase**: color-system-consolidation | **Status**: Waiting for Analysis | **Progress**: 0%

## Current Tasks
- [ ] **Architecture Design** - Define unified controller structure and interfaces
- [ ] **Core Implementation** - Build consolidated system with shared infrastructure
- [ ] **API Compatibility** - Implement backwards compatibility layer
- [ ] **Integration Points** - Register with system facades and coordinators
- [ ] **Testing & Validation** - Verify functionality and performance

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] Unified controller file(s) created with complete functionality
- [ ] All original system capabilities preserved or enhanced
- [ ] Legacy API compatibility maintained through delegation
- [ ] System registration completed in VisualSystemFacade and coordinators
- [ ] TypeScript builds cleanly with proper type safety

## Section Files
- `unified-controller-design.md` - Architecture and design specification
- `api-compatibility.md` - Backwards compatibility strategy
- `implementation-progress.md` - Development progress tracking

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Analysis section complete
- [ ] System architecture documented
- [ ] Consolidation approach validated
