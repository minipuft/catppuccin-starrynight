# Analysis Section Status

**Section**: Analysis | **Phase**: color-system-consolidation | **Status**: Not Started | **Progress**: 0%

## Current Tasks
- [ ] **System Inventory** - Catalog all systems in scope
- [ ] **Architecture Analysis** - Document current implementation patterns  
- [ ] **Dependency Mapping** - Map inter-system dependencies and conflicts
- [ ] **Consolidation Assessment** - Identify optimization opportunities
- [ ] **Implementation Planning** - Define unified architecture approach

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All systems analyzed with line counts and functionality mapping
- [ ] Architecture patterns documented with strengths/weaknesses
- [ ] Dependency graph created showing integration points
- [ ] Consolidation target identified with expected impact metrics
- [ ] Implementation approach validated for feasibility
