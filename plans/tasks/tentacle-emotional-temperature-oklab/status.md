# Tentacle Emotional Temperature OKLAB - Status

**Tentacle ID**: tentacle-emotional-temperature-oklab  
**Phase**: 2 - Emotional Temperature Enhancement  
**Status**: Pending Foundation Completion  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Depends On**: tentacle-oklab-foundation

## Objectives

Enhance the EmotionalTemperatureMapper with OKLAB-based perceptual color science for more natural emotional state transitions and temperature-based color adjustments.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. EmotionalTemperatureMapper OKLAB Enhancement
- [ ] Replace temperature filter calculations with OKLAB manipulations
- [ ] Implement smooth OKLAB-based emotional transitions
- [ ] Add perceptual intensity mapping
- [ ] Create emotional state interpolation in OKLAB space

### 2. Integration with ColorHarmonyEngine
- [ ] Enhance `calculateTemperatureBlendInfluence()` with OKLAB
- [ ] Implement perceptual temperature mapping
- [ ] Add music-to-OKLAB-chroma mapping
- [ ] Create emotional temperature CSS variable generation

### 3. CSS Variable Integration
- [ ] Generate OKLCH CSS variables for emotional states
- [ ] Implement real-time OKLAB-based color updates
- [ ] Add performance-optimized variable batching
- [ ] Create emotional temperature debugging tools

## Success Criteria

### Perceptual Quality
- Smoother emotional state transitions (≥30% improvement in perceptual smoothness)
- More natural temperature-based color shifts
- Better preservation of color relationships during emotional changes
- Enhanced music-to-emotion visual mapping accuracy

### Performance
- Maintain ≤60fps during emotional temperature updates
- ≤1ms additional frame time for OKLAB emotional processing
- ≤3% CPU impact increase over current system
- Memory usage ≤1MB additional for emotional color caching

### Integration
- Backward compatibility with existing emotional temperature system
- Seamless integration with ColorHarmonyEngine
- Full OKLCH CSS variable support
- Robust debugging and monitoring capabilities
