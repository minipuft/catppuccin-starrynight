- <50MB memory usage during extended sessions
- <30ms TypeScript compilation time
- <10% CPU overhead during idle

### Integration Requirements
- Spicetify API compatibility and graceful degradation
- Catppuccin color palette compliance
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
