#### Specific Actions:
- [ ] **Build Performance Baseline**:
  - Run `npm run build` and record compilation time
  - Document bundle size and composition
  - Record memory usage during build
- [ ] **Runtime Performance Baseline**:
  - Record initialization time
  - Document memory usage during runtime
  - Measure system startup sequence timing
- [ ] **Linting Status Documentation**:
  - Run `npm run lint:js` and document current state
  - Record any existing warnings/errors
  - Document TypeScript compilation status

#### Success Criteria:
- Complete performance baseline documented
- Current build metrics recorded
- Runtime metrics captured
- Linting status documented

### Task 4: Testing Environment Preparation 🧪 NOT STARTED
**Objective**: Prepare testing infrastructure for refactoring
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Priority**: MEDIUM

#### Specific Actions:
- [ ] **Test Suite Validation**:
  - Run `npm test` and document current coverage
  - Identify tests that need updating
  - Plan test updates for facade patterns
- [ ] **Backup Strategy Implementation**:
  - Create backup branch: `git branch refactor-facade-prep`
  - Document rollback procedures
  - Setup automated backup points
- [ ] **Development Environment Setup**:
  - Ensure YEAR3000_CONFIG.enableDebug is true
  - Verify all development tools are working
  - Setup performance monitoring

#### Success Criteria:
- Test suite running successfully
- Backup strategy implemented
- Development environment ready
- Performance monitoring active

### Task 5: Risk Assessment and Mitigation Planning 🛡️ NOT STARTED
**Objective**: Identify and plan mitigation for implementation risks
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Priority**: LOW

#### Specific Actions:
- [ ] **Technical Risk Analysis**:
  - Identify potential performance risks
  - Document integration complexity risks
  - Plan mitigation strategies
- [ ] **Implementation Risk Planning**:
  - Identify critical path dependencies
  - Plan staged rollout approach
  - Document contingency procedures
- [ ] **Quality Assurance Planning**:
  - Plan testing approach for each phase
  - Document quality gates
  - Setup continuous monitoring

#### Success Criteria:
- Risk assessment completed
- Mitigation strategies documented
- Quality gates defined
- Monitoring setup planned
