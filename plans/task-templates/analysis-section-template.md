## Analysis Methodology

### System Inventory Process
1. **File Discovery**: Use `find` and `grep` to locate all relevant system files
2. **Line Counting**: Document size and complexity of each system
3. **Function Mapping**: Identify primary responsibilities of each system
4. **API Analysis**: Document public interfaces and integration points

### Architecture Analysis Process  
1. **Pattern Identification**: Look for common architectural patterns
2. **Interface Analysis**: Document how systems communicate
3. **Dependency Tracking**: Map all inter-system dependencies
4. **Performance Profiling**: Identify performance bottlenecks

### Consolidation Assessment Process
1. **Similarity Analysis**: Identify systems with overlapping functionality
2. **Deduplication Potential**: Estimate code reduction opportunities
3. **Integration Complexity**: Assess difficulty of unification
4. **Risk Evaluation**: Identify potential issues with consolidation

## Tools and Commands

### Useful Analysis Commands
```bash
# System discovery
find src-js -name "*.ts" | grep -E "(System|Manager|Controller)" | sort

# Line counting
wc -l src-js/path/to/SystemFile.ts

# Dependency analysis  
grep -r "import.*SystemName" src-js/

# Function analysis
grep -n "export.*function\|export.*class" src-js/path/to/file.ts

# TODO/FIXME analysis
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX" src-js/
```

### Analysis Validation Checklist
- [ ] All systems documented with accurate metrics
- [ ] Dependencies verified through code inspection
- [ ] Consolidation estimates validated with similar past work
- [ ] Risk assessment includes technical and timeline factors
- [ ] Implementation approach feasible within project constraints
