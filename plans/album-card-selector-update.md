# Album Card Selector Update - Year3000 Design Standard Implementation

**Created:** 2025-10-03
**Status:** In Progress
**Goal:** Update card selectors to support new Spotify DOM while maintaining Year3000 design philosophy

---

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### Card Type Hierarchy
1. **Full Year3000 Treatment** (Visual + Music-Reactive)
   - Album cards (`[href*="/album/"]`)
   - Artist cards (`[href*="/artist/"]`)

2. **Visual Effects Only** (No Music Reactivity)
   - Playlist cards
   - Podcast cards
   - Generic content cards

3. **Minimal Effects** (Base + Interactions)
   - Search result cards
   - Sidebar library items

---

## üìä DOM Structure Analysis

### New Album Card Structure (2025)
```html
<div class="main-card-cardContainer" data-encore-id="card" aria-labelledby="card-title-*">
  <div role="button" class="CardButton-sc-g9vf2u-0"><!-- Interactive layer --></div>
  <div class="main-card-imageContainer">
    <div class="main-cardImage-imageWrapper">
      <img class="main-image-image" src="..." alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="main-card-PlayButtonContainer">
      <div class="main-playButton-PlayButton">
        <button>Play</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="Areas__MainArea">
    <p data-encore-id="cardTitle" class="main-card-cardTitle">Crest</p>
    <div data-encore-id="cardSubtitle">2022</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Legacy Album Card Structure (Pre-2025)
```html
<div class="main-card-card">
  <div class="main-card-header">
    <img class="main-cardImage-image" src="...">
    <div class="main-card-PlayButtonContainer">...</div>
  </div>
  <div class="main-card-cardMetadata">
    <a class="main-cardHeader-text">Title</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Key Selector Changes
| Element | Legacy Selector | New Selector | Notes |
|---------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Root Container | `.main-card-card` | `.main-card-cardContainer` | Both needed for compatibility |
| Image Container | `.main-card-header` | `.main-card-imageContainer` | Structure change |
| Title | `.main-cardHeader-text` | `[data-encore-id="cardTitle"]` | Stable data attribute |
| Subtitle | `.main-card-cardMetadata` | `[data-encore-id="cardSubtitle"]` | Stable data attribute |

## üé® Module Categorization & Selector Strategy

### üéµ ALBUM-SPECIFIC (Music-Reactive Effects)
**Selector Pattern:** Target only album/artist cards
```scss
.main-card-cardContainer[href*="/album/"],
.main-card-cardContainer[href*="/artist/"],
.main-card-card[href*="/album/"],
.main-card-card[href*="/artist/"] {
  // Music-reactive effects
}
```

**Modules:**
- [ ] `src/features/music-sync/_beat_synchronization.scss`
- [ ] `src/features/music-sync/ui/_audio-reactive-atmospherics.scss`
- [ ] `src/features/visual-effects/_beat_sync_glassmorphism.scss`

### üé® UNIVERSAL CARDS (All Card Types)
**Selector Pattern:** Target all cards equally
```scss
.main-card-cardContainer,
.main-card-card {
  // Universal visual effects
}
```

**Modules:**
- [ ] `src/components/_sn_card_base.scss` - Base structural styles
- [ ] `src/components/_sn_enhanced_cards.scss` - Enhanced effects (needs refinement)
- [ ] `src/features/visual-effects/_crystalline_glassmorphism.scss` - Static glass effects
- [ ] `src/features/interactions/_css_interactions.scss` - Ripple, hover, focus
- [ ] `src/features/interactions/_microinteractions.scss` - Subtle feedback
- [ ] `src/features/interactions/_text_visual_effects.scss` - Text effects

### üîß CONTEXT-AWARE (Grid/Layout)
**Modules:**
- [ ] `src/features/backgrounds/_grid_navigation_mode.scss`
- [ ] `src/components/_sn_active_loading_states.scss`
- [ ] `src/fixes/_white_layer_fixes.scss`

### üõ†Ô∏è FRAMEWORK (Design System)
**Modules:**
- [ ] `src/core/_design_tokens.scss`
- [ ] `src/core/_performance_mixins.scss`
- [ ] `src/features/interactions/_dynamic_interface.scss`

## üêõ Known Issues & Decisions

### Issue 1: Enhanced Cards Module Complexity
**Problem:** `_sn_enhanced_cards.scss` is 1220 lines and mixes music-reactive with universal effects
**Decision:** Keep single file but use conditional selectors to separate concerns
**Rationale:** Maintains existing architecture while adding specificity

### Issue 2: Play Button Selector
**Status:** ‚úÖ Already correct
**Selector:** `.main-card-PlayButtonContainer` works in both old and new DOM

### Issue 3: Image Container Change
**Problem:** `.main-card-header` ‚Üí `.main-card-imageContainer`
**Solution:** Support both selectors during transition period
**Files Affected:** `_sn_enhanced_cards.scss`, shelf 3D rendering fixes

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ All card types display correctly with new DOM
‚úÖ Album/artist cards have full music-reactive effects
‚úÖ Playlist/podcast cards have visual effects only
‚úÖ No visual regressions in any context
‚úÖ Performance maintained (60fps target)

## üõ†Ô∏è Image Loading Fixes Applied (2025-10-03)

### Issue Discovery
Investigation revealed potential image rendering issues caused by:
1. Backdrop-filter on card container (line 283) interfering with child elements
2. 3D transform contexts causing GPU backface culling
3. Missing universal image visibility safeguards

### Fixes Implemented

**Fix 1: Backdrop-Filter Safety** (`_sn_enhanced_cards.scss` lines 283-292)
- Added `@supports` check for backdrop-filter compatibility
- Provided fallback for browsers without support
- Prevents GPU compositing issues from hiding images

**Fix 2: Universal 3D Flattening** (`_sn_enhanced_cards.scss` lines 1114-1130)
- Added default `transform-style: flat` for all cards
- Prevents GPU backface culling across all contexts
- Opt-in mechanism (.preserve-3d-override) for specific needs
- Complements existing shelf-specific fix

**Fix 3: Universal Image Visibility** (`_sn_enhanced_cards.scss` lines 1156-1181)
- Force `opacity: 1 !important` on all card images
- Ensure `visibility: visible` and `backface-visibility: visible`
- Proper z-index stacking above backdrop-filter effects
- Covers all image classes and containers

### Build Validation
‚úÖ Theme compiles successfully
‚úÖ No CSS compilation errors
‚úÖ TypeScript type checking passed
‚úÖ Bundle generated: theme.js (2.4MB) + user.css

## üí° Notes & Observations

- Spotify is migrating to Encore design system (data-encore-id attributes)
- Styled-component classes (CardButton-sc-*) are unstable - avoid targeting
- Keep both old and new selectors for 6+ months transition period
- Consider creating helper mixins for common card selector patterns

### Implementation Strategy (100% Complete) ‚úÖ
**Foundation ‚Üí Enhancement ‚Üí Sophistication**
1. ‚úÖ Base structural layer (lowest risk, highest impact) - COMPLETE
2. ‚úÖ Interaction layer verification (critical UX) - COMPLETE
3. ‚úÖ Visual effects layer (static beauty) - COMPLETE
4. ‚úÖ Enhanced cards with conditional logic (complexity) - COMPLETE
5. ‚úÖ Music-reactive specificity (album/artist only) - COMPLETE
6. ‚úÖ Context-aware systems (grid, loading, fixes) - COMPLETE
7. ‚úÖ Framework integration (dynamic interface, microinteractions) - COMPLETE

## üöÄ Next Steps: Testing & Validation
